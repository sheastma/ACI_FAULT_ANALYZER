ACI Fault Analyzer (ALPHA)
=====================

Have you ever been troubleshooting a fault and been stuck wondering how it got there?
This tool is designed to make that process much easier. Gather some information from
your APIC, upload it to script, and the ACI Fault Analyzer will show you the relationship
between fabric faults and events. This makes it easier to see what events might have
caused which faults and can help you correct the issue faster.
 
Once you run the script, you're presented with a list of faults currently raised on your fabric.
Click on one of the faults and you're given a list of events that happened beforehand. You have
the option to set how far back from the fault you want to see, and we designed the script to sort
the event list based on relevance to the fault you're viewing.
